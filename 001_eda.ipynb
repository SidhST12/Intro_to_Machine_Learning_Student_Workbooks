The possibilities for this are endless, and we can build and modify on what we have, but some basics that we almost certainly want to explore are:\n",

    "## Create an EDA Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to create your own EDA class, optionally based on the example code above. There isn't one correct answer or one specific set of features that your tool needs to do. The overall goal is to do as much of the EDA process as possible, with the least work required each time. Some things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>How are different types of data represented and displayed?\n",
    "<li>What is important to know? E.g. outliers, correlations, distributions, etc...\n",
    "<li>How much customization is needed? Think about the Seaborn visualizations as an example, each chart has many options that we can optionally modify. E.g. pariplots can be useful, but can also take a long time to generate, would it be better if they were optional?\n",
    "<li>Code modularity - in general, breaking up large tasks into reusable pieces of code will be preferable. If/when you add to this later on, it'll be much easier. \n",
    "<li>Commenting - we'll comment this code in the correct manner. See the example for a pattern that should be enough to follow. Commenting is dull and boring, but generally very important; we leave it mainly to the coding class to cover proper comments, but we'll do it the 'proper' way here since we are creating a portable tool. If someone else was to use this, good comments allow them to make sense of it. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The example code isn't comprehensive or definitive, the intent is to give a few examples of how to put things together (tabs, matplotlib figures, classes, etc). You can use whatever you want to put this together, it is also a good chance to build skills in reading documentation for the differnet libraries to adapt things to what you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tool will be peer evaluated - you'll each try out 3 other people's EDA tools and judge how useful they are and how easy they are to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Utility File</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating this EDA class, place it in a regular python file, e.g. ml_utils.py. The python file is effectively just one big code cell and pretty much everything that you write should translate directly (there's a slight possibility you might need to adjust somehting, my sample worked as is. If so, Google the error, it is probably common, then ask me if you don't get it). This utility file can also stay with you and be built upon as we go forward; any common code that you use repeatedly can be built into a function in this file, then you can just import it (like thinkstats2 and thinkplot) to your notebook, and use those things without rewriting them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is really common, when programming we want to make things into reusable functions almost as often as possible. It saves us work, allows us to not have to think about the same challenge repeatedly, makes it easy to make improvements, and reduces the probablity of making an error. As we go, add to it! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For development purposes, use this function in the next part, predictions with trees. "
